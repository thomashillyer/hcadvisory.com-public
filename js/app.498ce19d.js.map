But over the\n                                    more than 30 years of satellite records, scientists have observed a clear pattern of\n                                    decline, decade-by-decade.\n                                </p>\n                                <p>The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the sea-ice then thaws every\n                                    summer, and that process will continue whatever happens with climate change. Even if\n                                    the Arctic continues to be one of the fastest-warming regions of the world, it will\n                                    always be plunged into bitterly cold polar dark every winter. And year-by-year, for\n                                    all kinds of natural reasons, there’s huge variety of the state of the ice.\n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"section\">\n                <div class=\"container\">\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                        <div class=\"col-md-8 ml-auto mr-auto\">\n                            <h3 class=\"title\">Rest of the Story:</h3>\n                            <p>We are here to make life better.
